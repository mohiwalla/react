## What I learnt today?

| Date | What I leant? | What I made? | Overall Experience... |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 24-09-2023   | I learnt to use `useState` hook along with passing the current state of a component to the `child` element | I made [ListGroup.tsx](https://github.com/mohiwalla/react/blob/mohiwalla/src/components/ListGroup.tsx) and [Search.tsx](https://github.com/mohiwalla/react/blob/mohiwalla/src/components/Search.tsx) file today to implement a search in `<ul>` (unordered List) and show the results matching the keyword in search box in real time. | It is different for me to `think in React âœŒ` and as of now making the same application seem to be easier for me to make in Vanila JS instead. But `GPT` helped me. ðŸ˜‹|
